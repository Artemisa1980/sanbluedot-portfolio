**Completed:**

### Framework setup
- Created global `/Code-ai/conductor.md` — portable PM brain (references owner-profile.md)
- Created global `/Code-ai/work-orchestra.md` — VSCode terminal instructions added
- Created global `/Code-ai/owner-profile.md` — Sandy's profile, token constraints, working style
- Created `.agents/project-hub.md` — shared agent brain with section map, status tracker, quality rules
- Updated portfolio-level `conductor.md` and `work-orchestra.md` to reference globals
- Updated portfolio-level `brutal-critic-(bc).md` to reference canonical `/Code-ai/skills/brutal-critic-(bc).md`

## HOW TO RESUME (for the next model)

1. Read `/Code-ai/conductor.md` — your PM identity and process
2. Read `/Code-ai/owner-profile.md` — who Sandy is and how she works
3. Read `.agents/project-hub.md` — project state, section map, status tracker
4. Read `instructions.md` at `/Code-ai/instructions.md` — full task list from Sandy
5. Start with the next pending task in `project-hub.md` status tracker

The upcoming work is the **games phase** (see `instructions.md` Games section):
- Arcade Station redesign: more slots (6+), smoother transitions, WebGL/Three.js
- Pac-Toe: full redesign with 3x3 / 5x5 / 7x7 grids, 6 levels each
- Zelda game in Mario Bros world
- Space race game (Star Wars theme)
- Stranger Things Pac-Man (Eleven + Demogorgon)
- All games + all sections must be responsive (phone, tablet, desktop)
- TV section: add 2 videos inside TVStudio (retro-vibe)
- Everything on website must be in English (TV synopses currently in Spanish — flag)
